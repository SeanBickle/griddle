## What is griddle?

griddle is a daily word search, inspired by wordle.

The grid of letters is generated by a GitHub Action every day at
(approximately) 00:00UTC and stored in `buffer.js`, so everyone griddles the
same griddle.

This project was originally created during a very windy weekeend in February
2022, so (like any pet project) there's a healthy amount of code which could
be improved.

## How to play

* Tap adjacent tiles to select a word
* Earn points for each tile in the word
* Earn 2x points for words with 7+ letters
* Enter up to five words a day and aim to achieve the highest possible score

## Wordlist
